Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

Step 2: From the EC2 Dashboard, select "Launch instance."

Step 3: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the Linux server. You can select from a range of Linux distributions available.

Step 4: Select the instance type that best suits your requirements, considering factors such as CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity.

Step 5: In the Key pair section, select "Create new key pair." This key pair will ensure secure connectivity to the instance via SSH. Remember to download and securely store the private key file (.pem) in a safe location.

Step 6: Configure the network settings, including the subnet and security group. If you're unsure, you can use the default settings. Make sure to allow SSH (port 22) access as incoming SSH traffic is blocked by default for security reasons.

Step 7: Configure the storage options for your instance. You can specify the size of the root volume and add any additional volumes if needed. Review all the configuration details you've set for the instance. If everything looks good, click on "Launch" to start the instance.

Step 8: Once the instance is running, you can connect to it using the command-line interface (CLI). Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your key pair file is stored.

Step 9: Go to the EC2 instance. locate the "Connect" section and click on the "Connect" button. In the connection dialog, you will find various options for connecting to your instance, such as EC2 Instance Connect, Session Manager, and SSH. Select the "SSH client" tab. Here, you will find the SSH command that you can copy and paste into your CLI. Press Enter to establish the SSH connection to your EC2 instance.
